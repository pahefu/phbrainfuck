phbrainfuck
===========

Small python interpreter for the [brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) language

Built as test after reading about AI + brainfuck article at [Primary Objecs](http://www.primaryobjects.com/CMS/Article149.aspx). I got no previous brainfuck practice, so i tried to make the interpreter part.

It's limited to 3000 bytes for the data pointer and to 8000 instructions (to prevent infinite loops). Both can be changed though.

Code is at beta, but is enough for a basic implementation and testing some 'Hello World' examples .

>\# python test.py

>Hello World!

>Hello world!
